## Introduction
DArchOS is a Linux distribution made on top of [ArchLinux-ARM][ArchLinux ARM],
focusing [Raspberry Pi 2/3 single-board computers][Raspberry Pi].

Developed to have simple installation and configuration with minimal user interaction
for installation, it packs lots of applications to make the system ready for usage
right after the installation.

## Purpose
After the shutdown of some ArchLinux-based distributions for ARM devices
(such like Manjaro-ARM) due to its difficulty to mantain repositories and packages,
this distribution was created to show it is possible to mantain a simpler distribution
when you use packages from AUR, taking away the weight of the developers that should
mantain binary packages, automated builds, repositories and mirrors.

This system is completely based on ArchLinux-ARM that uses AUR packages and packages
from other distros and repositories with the help of customizepkg package that
automates changes to PKGBUILD files.

It is installed by first installing ArchLinux-ARM with DArchOS script and configuration
files, and then running the script that will convert it to DArchOS by installing
packages and configurations.

## Requirements
* Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3 single-board computer
* MicroSD with at least 16GB of storage (32GB or better recommended)
* MicroSD card reader/writer
* Stable network connection or good Wifi connection with WPA/WPA2 security (cabled
connection recommended)

## How to Install
1. Prepare the MicroSD using [DArchOS Prepare][DArchOS Prepare] following its steps
2. Insert the MicroSD in your Raspberry Pi 2/3
3. Apply 5V power to boot the Raspberry Pi
4. Wait for it to install and prepare the system for you (it will reboot when it is done)
â€” usually take some hours
5. Login with your user and that's it
